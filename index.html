    <h1>Sri Lankan Mangroves </h1>
    <p>
    In the island of Sri Lanka there is an intereting fact about the mangroves and it is one of natural made structure that glows the beauty of the beauty 
    of the Sri Lankan Wildlife. Mangroves are known for stablizing coastlines and also prevent waves and current tides that can damage the soil structure 
    which means it prevents soil erosion. Mangroves provide natural infrastructure to help protect nearby populated areas by reducing erosion and absorbing 
    storm surge impacts during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. They are also important to the ecosystem too. Their dense roots help bind and build soils
    Largest mangrove areas in the country are located in the Puttalam Lagoon-Dutch Bay-Portugal Bay complex in the west and Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the east.
    here is a well-developed mangrove ecosystem throughout the coastal belt. About 28 species of true mangroves and 18 mangrove associates have been recorded 
    and many of them are shrubs, shorter than 10 m.

    <h1>Sri Lankan Marines </h1>
    <p>
    marine life in the surrounding Indian Ocean. The coastal waters of Sri Lanka are home to an array of marine species, including colorful coral reefs, tropical fish, and fascinating invertebrates. The island's coral reefs, found along its coastline, are particularly noteworthy for their biodiversity, providing shelter and sustenance for a myriad of marine organisms. Diverse species of coral, such as branching corals and massive corals, create complex underwater ecosystems that support an abundance of marine life.

    The marine wildlife in Sri Lanka also includes a variety of fish species, ranging from small reef fish to larger pelagic species that inhabit the open ocean. The island's coastal areas serve as important breeding grounds for sea turtles, and Sri Lanka is home to several species, including the Olive Ridley, Green, and Hawksbill turtles. Furthermore, the waters around Sri Lanka are frequented by majestic marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales, making it a popular destination for marine enthusiasts seeking the thrill of witnessing these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Conservation efforts focus on protecting these marine ecosystems, raising awareness about the importance of sustainable practices, and ensuring the continued existence of Sri Lanka's diverse and precious marine wildlife.

        <h1>Sri Lankan indegenous animal </h1>
        <p>
        Sri Lanka is home to a unique array of indigenous animals, showcasing the country's remarkable biodiversity. One such iconic species is the Sri Lankan Elephant (Elephas maximus maximus), a subspecies of the Asian Elephant. Revered as a symbol of the nation, these majestic creatures roam the island's national parks and wildlife reserves. With distinctive features such as relatively small ears and a more pronounced forehead, the Sri Lankan Elephant is well adapted to its local habitat. However, these magnificent animals face threats from habitat loss and human-elephant conflicts, prompting conservation efforts to protect both the elephants and the ecosystems they inhabit.

        Another notable indigenous species is the Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus), also known as the Purple-faced Leaf Monkey. Endemic to Sri Lanka, these primates are recognized for their striking appearance, featuring a purple face surrounded by black fur. Living in the island's dense forests, the Purple-faced Langur plays a crucial role in seed dispersal, contributing to the regeneration of plant species. Conservation initiatives aim to safeguard the habitats of these indigenous animals, recognizing their importance in maintaining the delicate balance of Sri Lanka's ecosystems.
