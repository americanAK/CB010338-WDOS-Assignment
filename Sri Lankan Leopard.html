                    of the jungle never made it to this island in the history but theres another feline species that still
                    roam around in the Sri Lankas wildlife which is the Sri lankan Leopard.

                <h2>Leopard found in Sri Lanka</h2>
                
                One of the national park would be the Yala National park. Located in the South East Sri Lanka Yala would be the 
                first stop as Yala is famously known for its most densely populated leopard presence on earth. Theres an estimated
                40 Leopards roaming around the Yala National Park. The national park is 950 Square Kilometers wide and it is home to
                other wild species like elephants, deer, sloth bears, Jackals and other wild species.
               
        
                The Next national park for sightseeing Leopard would be the Wilpathu National park. It is known to be the biggest 
                national park in Sri Lanka located in north west low lands which once a famous place for seeing Leopards in the country
                However the area suffered heavily due to the Sri Lankan civil war that lasted 3 Decades and was closed for 15 years until
                it was open on 2003. The park is sligthly less busier than yala but the same wildlife roams around as the one in Yala.
                
        
                The last or least of National park would be the Udawalawe National park which is known for a place to elephant and it is 
                4 hours away from colombo by a car and the park is 300 square Kilometers wide in size which is a little smaller than yala. 
                The forest is little covered due to the a season of severe monsoon rains and flooding. Theres a lot of wildlife along with 
                elephant, monkeys, water buffalo and chamaleons. Sloth bears and Leopards arent that heard of during sight seeing and is very 
                rare

                <h2>What are the threats that Sri lankan leopard face</h2>  

                Sri Lankan leopard is one of the big cats that is distrbuted throughout the sub saharan Africa and several
                countries in Asia. Today theyre one of the remaining felines that are the most distributed around the world. 
                Out of all nine genetically distincted species it is known that the Sri Lankan leopard are one of the two 
                island sub species. Due to the island of Sri Lankas geographical isolation Sri Lankan Leopard are one of the 
                restrcited range species. Today Sri Lankan Leopard faces major issues as the population 22 million in Sri Lanka
                slowly move towards cultivating farmlands, livelystocks and settlements which was many years ago belonging to 
                the wild life.
                <h3>Conflicts between farmers and Leopards</h3>
                As the number of the preys in the wildlife declines leopards turn their feast towards the live stocks which are 
                taken cared by the farmers and human settlements which leads to a conflict between human population and the 
                leopards which never goes well to the leopards and therefore leading the leopards to vulnerable. Leopards normally
                enter unprotected areas and therefore end up in danger due to illegal hunting and wire snare traps set for poachers
                to catch other different bushmeats other animals. There are other issues such as leopards dying from poisoned caracases
                once a feline big cat that walked the surface of the islands thoughout the history are now locally getting exctinct.
                As the Sri Lankan Leopard are one of the endagered species in the world more should be done to protect the future of 
                the Sri Lankan Leopard. The Department of the wildlife conservation has to enficiently manage the protect the area of
                network and strictly enforce the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance throughout the island. For a long term protection
                of the leopards is to educate the younger generations and also protest and spread information to the public and policy 
                makers the importance of conserving the endagered species and to also solve the conlfict.
                
                THere are neccesary steps taken to spread awareness and information to the general public such as the action taken by the 
                Wildlife and Nature protection Society (WNPS) canvassed the decelation of the Sri Lanka Leopard day on August 1 and also 
                taking action like partnering with the LOLC Holdings PLC to establish a network to conservation areas and research centers
                across the country.
