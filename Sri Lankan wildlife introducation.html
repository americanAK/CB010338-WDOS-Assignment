            <h1>Seven Wildlife Higlights:</h1>
            <h2>Seven animals you have to see in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean</h2>
            <p>
                Like many islands, Sri Lanka boasts a high number of endemic species, animals and plants found nowhere else on Earth.
                The country is also regarded as one of the world's top five hotspots for biodiversity, 
                testament to the sheer number of species which call the tear drop isle home. 
                 Sri Lanka teems with wildlife. From great herds of trumpeting Asian elephants to elusive leopards and strange looking sloth bears,
                  the country's national parks are home to all manner of amazing creatures.
                 Here's a guide to what you can expect to see during your visit.The Sri Lanka department of Wildlife Conservation recently published a 
                 list of the seven most iconic wild animals in the island as a way of promoting tourism 
                 and the conservation of all species in and outside this list.
                Sri Lanka is somewhat of an outlier when it comes to biodiversity. 
                Experts have been studying the biodiversity of this small island since the early 20th century, and all with good reason. 
                The number of animal species in the island is said to be five times as much as it is supposed to be in an island of its size,
                 and the number of endemic species in the country is amazing. From endemic birds to endemic primates, Sri Lanka has them all. 
                The wonder of Sri Lanka – being such a small island – is that you don’t have to travel far to see any of them.

                The park is home to 32 mammal species, with a visitor highlight being the sight of herds of elephants swimming across the reservoir from one island to another

                As part of Sri Lanka’s elephant corridor, large numbers of elephants migrate across the country to Minneriya every year.
                Known as ‘The Gathering’, as many as 300 come to the park’s reservoir in the largest meeting of Asian elephants anywhere in the world.

                    Large areas of the park are covered in pristine cloud forest, with dramatically plunging cliffs at its southern boundary. 
                    Home to a variety of endemic species, it’s one of the best places for bird watching.

                        these magnificent animals are a symbol of Sri Lanka as much as anything.
                        Once extensively hunted for their ivory, the population of elephants in Sri Lanka dwindled to a few thousand, from a few hundreds of thousand before colonisation. Although the number of elephants with tusks has dropped dramatically as a result, 
                        the overall population of elephants has somewhat stabilised in the country due to conservation efforts in the country.
                        Elephants were very much a part of everyday life until very recently in Sri Lanka. They have been used in the logging industry and continue to be part of the cultural procession known as the Kandy Perahera.
                        to get the best elephant experience, though, you have to see them in their natural habitat. The Yala and Minneriya National Parks, as well as a few other national parks around the country, are prime locations to view these giants in the wild.
                        Sri Lanka Safaris offers great opportunities to view Sri Lankan elephants in their element. Our expert guides know where to find the herds of pachyderms, so that you get the best experience.

                        Sloth bears are basically termite eaters, and are known to supplement their diet of with other insects, honey, fruits, and other plant matter.
                        Sloth Bears are excellent climbers, and are known to be able to climb tall trees to reach honeycombs.
                        
                        Usually found in Sri lanka’s Eastern and Northern lowland forests in the dry zone, 
                        Sloth Bears travel in pairs or small family units, with males usually gentle with cubs, and females being generally protective. 
                        Sloth bears were once found throughout the island, but loss of their habitat due to aggressive land use for agriculture has meant that their numbers have dwindled. 
                        Hunting for sport during colonial times also led to the decline in these bears.
                        
                        Seeing sloth bears in the wild is a rare experience, and Sri Lanka Safaris’ expert guides give you the best chance to see these bears in their natural habitat. Inquire and book today!</td>

                        they typically live alone, as couples, or as small family groups.

                        Sri Lanka’s many wetlands are ideal for these large storks to thrive, as they are rich in the stork’s 
                        food sources, which can include crabs and other crustaceans, molluscs, bird and turtle eggs, and even other small aquatic birds, 
                        which they catch using their large bill.
                        
                        Black-necked Storks get their name from the distinct glossy and iridescent bluish black colour of their head and neck. 
                        Other visual cues to identify them are the flight feathers and tail of the same colour, bright white belly and back, and bright red legs.
                         Females and males look very similar, except for the colour of their iris – in females, it’s yellow, and in males, it’s brown.
                        
                        The IUCN has named this species Near Threatned, due to loss of wetland habitat over the past few years.
                        
                        Sri Lanka Safaris offers you some great opportunities to see this large stork in a few of Sri Lanka’s national parks, such as Yala and Minneriya.</td>
